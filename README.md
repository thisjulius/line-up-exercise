# Line-up Exercise

Welcome to the **Line-up Exercise** repository! This project aims to provide a template for setting up a project that interacts with an API using a token stored in a `.env` file that can display content from Line-up REST API.
This README will guide you through the process of cloning the repository, installing the necessary dependencies, and configuring your API token.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Git: [Download and Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Node.js and npm: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Your API token: You should have received an API token from Line-up.

### Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/thisjulius/line-up-exercise.git ``` 

### Install Dependencies
1. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory:
    ``` cd project-name```
2. Install dependencies: ``` npm install ``` 

### Configure API Token
In the root directory of the project, ```create a .env file```.
Open the .env file in a text editor of your choice.
Add your API token to the .env file in the following format:
```REACT_APP_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here```

### Usage
With the project set up and the API token configured, you can now run the project:
```npm start```
